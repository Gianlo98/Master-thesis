The comprehension of software evolution is essential for the understandability and maintainability of systems.
However, the sheer quantity and complexity of the information generated during systems development make the comprehension process challenging.
We present an approach, based on the concept of synesthesia (the production of a sense impression relating to one sense by stimulation of another sense),
which represents the evolutionary process through an interactive visual depiction of the evolving software artifacts complemented by an auditive portrayal of the evolution.
The approach is exemplified in SYN, a web application, which enables sensorial software evolution comprehension.
We applied SYN on real-life systems and presented several insights and reflections.
