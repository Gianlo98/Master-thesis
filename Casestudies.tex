\chapter[Case studies]{Case studies}
\graphicspath{ {images/casestudies} }

This chapter presents an actual case use scenario of SYN applied to open-source software systems. 
We use SYN to analyze the evolution of JetUML, the test project on which we relied during the development phase of the platform, ArgoUML, Elasticsearch, and Linux. 
\autoref{tab:casestudies} describes the characteristics of these systems.

\bigbreak
There are many possible combinations to create a view specification; we explored them on all the projects. 
Each visualization has its purpose. For example, we can create a visualization to see the evolution of only Java files, or we can create a visualization to see how the system evolved every day. 
However, not all the combinations might have sense. For example, if we chose a timestamp grouping strategy, the time window must be chosen conscientiously. 
A comprehensive time window might hide some exciting aspects of the analysis. In contrast, a short time window could cause a massive number of AnimationFrames, undermining the understandability of the view. 
\bigbreak
A constant factor of all our visualization is the choice not to show deleted entities, the adoption of a LinearBucketValueStrategy for the mapper with a maximum height of 20, and finally, to display files that do not have the selected metric on the visualization. 
These properties are set as follow:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{showUnmappedEntities}: true.
    \item \texttt{mapperStrategy}: LinearBucketValueStrategy.
    \item \texttt{mapperStrategyOptions}: max height of 20.
    \item \texttt{showDeletedEntities}: false.
\end{itemize}
We made this choice because, during the development process, we have seen that the LinearBucketValueStrategy works better than other strategies. Of course, it needs a maximum height because otherwise, the gap between entities is too broad. Therefore set this value to 20. Moreover, we believe that hiding the deleted entities is the most intuitive thing for the user. On the other hand, hiding the unmapped entities might be misleading in some visualization. For this reason, we preferred to keep them.

\section{JetUML}
This section analyzes JetUML, an open-source desktop application to work with UML diagrams. It is hosted on GitHub at the following address \url{https://github.com/prmr/JetUML}. Data collected in our analysis shows that the history of the repository starts on the 07 Jan, 2015 and it ends 2'013 commits later on the 12 May, 2022. System's lifetime is over 7 years of activity; within this range we detected 795 FileHistories and more than 10K FileVersions.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Comparison of commits with a low and an high activity} 
    \label{fig:JetUML_V0E0}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Goal of this visualization} Visualize the entire repository commit by commit to see how the repository evolved and understand commits with high activity. 
To highlight them, we use a one-commit aging strategy, maximum age of two. In other words, files modified by the displayed commit have an age of zero, whereas others have an age of one.
Consequently, all the files not included in the depicted commit are painted with the base color (gray by default). 

Figure \ref{fig:JetUML_V0E0} shows the graphical difference between commits that modified a few entities and commits that changed numerous entities. To identify highly active commits, we focused on commits that involved a considerable amount of files part of the repository at that time.

The view specification of this visualization is the following
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{versionGroupingStrategy}: commit.
    \item \texttt{versionGroupingChunkSize}: 1. 
    \item \texttt{colorPalette}: default.
    \item \texttt{agingGroupingStrategy}: commit.
    \item \texttt{agingStepSize}: 1.
    \item \texttt{agingSteps}: 2 steps. 
    \item \texttt{mapperMetricName}: SIZE. 
    \item \texttt{fileTypeShape}: all boxes.
    \item \texttt{fileTypeOpacity}: all 1. 
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:JetUML_V0S1}
\end{figure}

Here we present some results that we found looking at the graphical evolution of JetUML. 
To keep this section short, we report only a subset of the most active commits. 
\bigbreak
The repository's history starts on January 7, 2015, when Martin Robillard made the first commit. 
This commit added three files: README, a license, and a gitingore. 
Figure \ref{fig:JetUML_V0S1} represents it with three entities. They all have the same shape because we did not adopt different shapes in the specification, but the height is different. The license file is taller than other entities because of its bigger size. 
\bigbreak
Fifteen minutes later, he pushed the initial codebase of a project named Violet, composed of 83 files and an updated version of the gitignore file. This commit is represented in figure \ref{fig:JetUML_V0S2}, where 83 green entities represent added files, one yellow entity represents the updated gitignore files, and two gray entities, the README and the license files added before, that were not touched.
\bigbreak
Forty minutes later, he made the first big refactor of the system, whose goal was to move the position of some fields in each class. This refactoring involved 49 files, and as we can see from figure \ref{fig:JetUML_V0S3} they are marked in yellow. 
\bigbreak
Three days later, after a series of delicate development tasks had been continuously made, he moved some classes from the Violet folder to a new one named Violetta. As we can notice from figure \ref{fig:JetUML_V0S4} moved classes are represented with light blue. 
\bigbreak
Twenty-six commits later, on January 22, 2015, they moved classes from Violet and Violetta under the JetUML package. This commit, represented in figure \ref{fig:JetUML_V0S5}, was the first when JetUML was officially used; it denotes its birth. 
\bigbreak
After this first implementation, the system gradually grew, doubling its size in less than two years. 
During this time interval, they have been made only small commits to solve open issues. However, some exceptions were displayed in figure \ref{fig:JetUML_V0S6} and \ref{fig:JetUML_V0S7} where many files were modified because they had to update classes copyright lines. 
\bigbreak
In November 2017, they removed "stg" from the path of all the Java classes part of the system. This commit is depicted in figure \ref{fig:JetUML_V0S8}, where we can observe 162 light blue entities. They represent classes moved from the "../ca/mcgill/cs/stg/jetuml/..." path to the 
"../ca/mcgill/cs/jetuml/..." path. Moreover, this commit also had 15 modified fields, and one added. 
\bigbreak
One last huge refactor was done in July 2020, two years later, again to change the copyright on every class. It is represented in figure \ref{fig:JetUML_V0S9}. In this figure, we can notice that there are many blank spots in the middle. This means that entities added in the early stages of the project have been removed and are no longer part of the system. At that time, the system had 316 entities, and 241 were affected by this commit. 
\bigbreak
The last version of the system, created on Thu, May 12, 2022, counts 456 entities. 
\bigbreak
\textbf{Conclusion}
We manually inspected 2153 frames depicting the evolution of JetUML.
Thanks to the autoplay feature of SYN-Debugger, it was not an agonizing activity. \\
Occasionally JetUML needed to make huge commits involving most files on their repository. Nonetheless, they were spotted easily, thanks to the adopted visualization settings. 
Most of the commits involved few entities; this means that features were implemented gradually, maybe following an incremental or spiral development approach. 
With this grouping strategy, it was hard to understand the regularity and the speed of the development process. This is normal when we traverse the history by commit rather than traverse it by time.

\subsection{View 2}
\textbf{Goal of this visualization}
With this visualization, we want to see how the repository evolved through its first six months. 
The authors of JetUML, during this interval of time, made seven pre-releases of the system. 
Moreover, we want to show what an aging strategy of one month with ten steps looks like. 

\bigbreak
View specification adopted: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{versionGroupingStrategy}: timestamp.
    \item \texttt{versionGroupingChunkSize}: 2'629'743 (1 month). 
    \item \texttt{colorPalette}: default.
    \item \texttt{agingGroupingStrategy}: timestamp.
    \item \texttt{agingStepSize}: 2'629'743 (1 month).
    \item \texttt{agingSteps}: 10 steps.
    \item \texttt{mapperMetricName}: SIZE. 
    \item \texttt{fileTypeShape}: all BOX. 
    \item \texttt{fileTypeOpacity}: all 1. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Results}
\autoref{fig:JetUML_V1} shows the evolution of JetUML during its first 6 months. \autoref{fig:JetUML_V1S1} shows the state of the repository after its first month. All the entities are painted with the color representing the last action made on that file. All the colors are bright because the age of all the files is set to 0 since the time elapsed between their last action and the last commit of the visualization cannot be higher than one month. The second month is depicted in \autoref{fig:JetUML_V1S2}. Here we can easily spot older entities as they are darker than others. This means that some files had not been touched since the first month at the end of the second month. In the third and the fourth month, more or less the same amount of files was updated. However, in the fifth month, only three entities were modified; consequently, all the others are darker because they are older. 
At the end of the sixth month, two entities were added and modified. However, most of the entities were still getting older. 

\textbf{Conclusion}
We have seen how different is the timestamp strategy compared to what we saw in the first visualization. Here, the number of frames does not depend upon the number of commits made; instead, it relies on the number of months part of the history. 
However, the choice of the aging strategy also played a crucial role in this visualization. It highlighted updated entities without hiding the last action made on the others. Looking at \autoref{fig:JetUML_V1S6} we can immediately see that many files were added and never touched because their color looks dark green. The cause of this inactivity on the file may be related to the file type, and this limits our visualization because we cannot infer the type in any way. 


% With this visualization, we want to see how all JetUML files evolved through time. 
% JetUML does not seem to have a fixed release cycle.
% Since its history spans eight years of activity; we initially chose a timestamp grouping strategy of one month. 
% As a consequence, we have 89 AnimationFrames. 
% In this first visualization, we do not care about the FileType of entities; we are interested in all of them. 
% Grouping commits monthly; we applied the same strategy to the aging to see how many months had passed since an entity was modified. 
% To summarize, the view specification of this visualization is the following:

% Figure \ref{fig:JetUML_V1} shows the first 6 month of evolution of JetUML. 
% We can infer many things by looking at these figures. In figure \ref{fig:JetUML_V1S1} 7 entities have been moved. 
% Most of them are files with the extension \texttt{.properties}, and perhaps they were involved in a refactoring activity since their path changed from
% \texttt{src/ca/mcgill/cs/stg/jetuml/...} to \texttt{src/ca/mcgill/cs/stg/jetuml/diagrams/...}. 
% At the end of their first month of activity, they had 135 files and made 127 commits. 
% We can see many files are still green. This means that they were added but never touched after. 
% An issue with this visualization is that we cannot distinguish Java files from others. 
% These added files are images. Therefore it is not a surprise that once added; they are never modified in the future. 
% In figure \ref{fig:JetUML_V1S2} where the second month is represented, we can see that some entities have a darker color. 
% This means that during the second month, they were not touched. 
% Comparing all the figures until figure \ref{fig:JetUML_V1S6} we can notice that many entities have the same behavior. 
% They were added and updated in the first month of activity (this is why they are yellow), and then they were never touched, becoming darker and darker each month.

\subsection{View 3}
\textbf{Goal of this visualization}
In this third and last visualization that we propose, the goal is to study the entire evolution of the system, with a focus on Java files. 
To do that, the use the shape and opacity property of a ViewFigure, to distinguish them among others. 
To display the evolution of the system we adopt a timestamp grouping strategy, with a timestamp of one year. 
Furthermore, we also use a timestamp strategy for the aging, with a total of ten steps and a time window of one month. This means that grey entities represent files that have not been received any update for the last 10 month from the time of the displayed AnimationFrame. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{versionGroupingStrategy}: timestamp.
    \item \texttt{versionGroupingChunkSize}: 31'556'926 (1 year). 
    \item \texttt{colorPalette}: default.
    \item \texttt{agingGroupingStrategy}: timestamp.
    \item \texttt{agingStepSize}: 2'629'743 (1 month).
    \item \texttt{agingSteps}: 10 steps. 
    \item \texttt{mapperMetricName}: SLOC. 
    \item \texttt{fileTypeShape}: Java -> BOX, OTHERS -> SPHERE. 
    \item \texttt{fileTypeOpacity}: Java -> max, OTHERS -> low. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Results}
The whole evolution of JetUML is depicted in \autoref{fig:JetUML_V3}. As we notice, it is straightforward to distinguish java files from others because they have different shapes and other files are less opaque. After the first year of development, the state of the repository is shown in \autoref{fig:JetUML_V3S1}. We notice that all the Java files have more or less the same age. This means that all of them were updated after the second month because otherwise, they would be grey. The system grew at the end of the second year, shown in figure \autoref{fig:JetUML_V3S2} and now we can see some grey entities. Most of them are in the middle, meaning that the "core" files, or the files added before others, were not touched after the fourteenth month.  \autoref{fig:JetUML_V3S3} shows the state of the repository at the end of the third year. The system grew, and all the Java files were updated recently. Considering what we have seen in the first visualization, they had to change the path from all the Java files (\autoref{fig:JetUML_V0S8}). Perhaps this can be why all the entities were updated, and some ViewFigures are painted with the blue color. The fourth year of development, shown in  \autoref{fig:JetUML_V3S4} recorded a little activity in the first months because the system grew, and almost all the entities have a different color. However, it tends to be close to the base color, meaning they are old. 
\autoref{fig:JetUML_V3S5},  \autoref{fig:JetUML_V3S6} and  \autoref{fig:JetUML_V3S7} shows how the system evolved through the fifth, sixth and seventh year. The fifth year recorded an intense activity compared to what we saw in the fourth year. Lots of files were added, and most of the classes of the system were modified. Moreover, the system's center is slowly disappearing, meaning that new ones have replaced old Java files. In the sixth and seventh years, non-Java files were added, and some Java classes were updated outside the system's core. Finally, the last year, represented by \autoref{fig:JetUML_V3S8}, did not record such a huge activity on the system. It became inactive since almost all the entities are grey, meaning that these files were not touched in the last ten months of evolution. However, in this frame, appeared the two tallest entities of the system. This means that in this last year, two java files were added (they were not present the year before), and they rapidly became the biggest files in the repository.  
\bigbreak
\textbf{Conclusion}
With this visualization, we have seen JetUML from another point of view. The year visualization works very well with systems like JetUML with a comprehensive history. In fact, with just 8 AnimationFrames, we can infer when the development process was more intense in the past.

\section{ArgoUML}
This section analyzes ArgoUML, a leading open source UML modeling tool that includes support for all standard UML diagrams. 
It is hosted on GitHub at the following address \url{https://github.com/argouml-tigris-org/argouml}. 
This repository was born in January 1998 then it was converted from CVS to Subversion in 2006 and finally it was moved to git in 2019.
Therefore, it has more than 23 years of history. 
Our analysis considered 16'672 commits, 11'129 FileHistories and more than 90K FileVersions. 

\subsection{View 4}
\label{subsec:view4}
\textbf{Goal of this visualization}
The goal of this visualization is to see how the repository evolved through these 23 years. Therefore we decided to adopt a commit grouping strategy based on a time window of 1 year and an aging strategy of one month with a total of 12 steps. Hence, grey entities represent files that have not been updated for more than 12 months. 

\bigbreak
View specification adopted: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{versionGroupingStrategy}: timestamp.
    \item \texttt{versionGroupingChunkSize}: 31'556'926 (1 year). 
    \item \texttt{colorPalette}: default.
    \item \texttt{agingGroupingStrategy}: timestamp.
    \item \texttt{agingStepSize}: 2'629'743 (1 month).
    \item \texttt{agingSteps}: 12 steps.
    \item \texttt{mapperMetricName}: SIZE. 
    \item \texttt{fileTypeShape}: all BOX. 
    \item \texttt{fileTypeOpacity}: all 1. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Results}
Here we present only the relevant aspetcs of the ArgoUML evolution that we have found. However, in \autoref{app:ArgoUML_Evolution} the full evolution is depicted. \autoref{fig:JetUML_V3} shows the hot spots during the evolution of the system. \autoref{fig:ArgoUML_V3_S1} shows the state of the system after the fist year of activity. As we can notice, almost all the entities have color different than gray. This means that they were updated between April 1998 and Jenuary 1999 because otherwise they should be darker or gray. The size of the system was constantly increasing when in 2003, as \autoref{fig:ArgoUML_V3_S2} shows, the core of the system was entirely rewritten. 3 years later it had another important refactoring; in fact as we can see in figure \autoref{fig:ArgoUML_V3_S3} there are some empty rings around the center and a bigger size than the year before. Our interpretation of this event is that an entire set of consequently added files was removed and maybe later added again. It is important to underline that these files were deleted, not moved or renamed because otherwise SYN would treat them as the same logical entity. The same event happened 4 years later, when the system was 10 years old. The 2010 was the last truly active year for the repository. As depicted in \autoref{fig:ArgoUML_V3_S5}, almost all the repository files where modified and moreover, we can clearly notice more taller entities, meaning that the overall size of the files increased. The system did not grow up anymore afther that year. Sometimes some files were updated until the 2014 when it became almost dead. During the 2019 they made a commit that removed lots of files \footnote{\url{https://github.com/argouml-tigris-org/argouml/commit/62d5393eeaf08b749b17107faef255a22da55ce5}}. As a result, in Jenuary 2020, as represented in \autoref{fig:ArgoUML_V3_S6}, the visualizaion has more blank spots and since there were no activity, with the exceptions of few files, almost all the entities are painted with gray. In June 2022 the system is pretty identical to its version of 2020. 

\bigbreak
\textbf{Conclusion}
Thanks to this analysis, we have understood the composition of JetUML and at which speed it grew. Thanks to the spiral layout, where entities are added based on their timestamp, we can understand that in the final version lots of older files were removed. They had to be rewritten somewhere else, because otherwise the system would have less features than before. Moreover, thanks to the aging strategy we have understood that there were many dead time during the development lifecycle of the repository. Nonetheless, some of them are not shown in \autoref{fig:JetUML_V3}, they can be found in \autoref{app:ArgoUML_Evolution}. The system became almost dead in 2014 and since that year most of the files was never updated.

\section{Elasticsearch}
This section analyzes Elasticsearch, a distributed, RESTful JSON-based search and analytics engine. 
The project is open-souce and hosted on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch}. 
The first commit was made on June 2013, even through it was not the real first commit because the project started 4 years before in 2009. 
Our analysis comphrend almost 9 years of history, in which there are 34'843 ProjectVersions, 41'043 FileHistories and more than 300K FileVersions. 

\subsection{View 5}
\textbf{Goal of this visualization}
The goal of this visualization is to see how the repository evolved through its last 9 years. We decided to adopt a commit grouping strategy based on a time window of 1 year and an aging strategy of one month with a total of 12 steps. Hence, grey entities represent files that have not been updated for more than 12 months. 

\bigbreak
View specification adopted: same as the one defined for the View 4 (\autoref{subsec:view4}).

\textbf{Results}
Here we present only the relevant aspetcs of the ArgoUML evolution that we have found. However, in \autoref{app:Elastic_Evolution} the full evolution is depicted. \autoref{fig:Elastic_V5} shows the hot spots during the evolution of the system. \autoref{fig:Elastic_V5_S1} shows the initial size of the system when the system became opensource and was officially moved on GitHub. After one year of inactivity, the size of the system, in June 2016, was almost the triple of 2 years before. In fact, if on June 2014 it had 2'904 files, on June 2016 it had 9'537 files. However, in figure \autoref{fig:Elastic_V5_S2} we can notice that only the entities around the center of the system were touched. This means that the initial implementation of elastic remained untouched and that any of the files added in the 2013 were modified. Pheraps the code was stable enought that it did not require any maintainance and only new features were added before June 2016. After one year of stop, in June 2018 we had another big increment of the system, as shown by \autoref{fig:Elastic_V5_S3}. Also there it doubled its size. The interesting fact is that also here the core remained untouched, with the exception of very few changes. Moreover, the height of entitites present in \autoref{fig:Elastic_V5_S2} became higher. This not only means that they were modified, but it might means that on these classes new features were added. We recorded the same growing pattern later in time until June 2022. As depicted in \autoref{fig:Elastic_V5_S4}, \autoref{fig:Elastic_V5_S5}, \autoref{fig:Elastic_V5_S6} the system incremented the number and the size of files gradually. The most important thig, is that with the exeption of the center, most of the files are painted with a bright colo, meaning that they are maintained. 


\bigbreak
\textbf{Conclusion} This analysis highlited many intresting aspects of the Elasticsearch evolution. Among all, the most important might be that the core of the system once developed was never touched (with the exception of very fiew entities). As we can notice from the figures shown in  \autoref{fig:Elastic_V5}, it is always depicted in gray, even if files around it are modified even in the last year of evolution.

\section{Libreoffice}
LibreOffice is an integrated office suite compatible with most document formats and standards. Its first commit \footnote{\url{https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/commit/5acbb755f3f8dedf51904b711ff78f5e1aa498cf}}, made on 07 March 2002 was an import of the original codebase developed by Sun Microsystems. The history of the repository is 20 years long with 327'996 commits, 213'791 FileHistories and almost 2M FileVersions. 

\subsection{View 6}
\textbf{Goal of this visualization}
The goal of this visualization is to see how the repository evolved through its last 20 years. We decided to adopt a commit grouping strategy based on a time window of 1 year and an aging strategy of one month with a total of 12 steps. Hence, grey entities represent files that have not been updated for more than 12 months. 

\bigbreak
View specification adopted: same as the one defined for the View 4 (\autoref{subsec:view4}).

\textbf{Results}
Here we present only the relevant aspetcs of the ArgoUML evolution that we have found. However, in \autoref{app:Libre_Evolution} the full evolution is depicted. \autoref{fig:Libre_V6} shows the hot spots during the evolution of the system. The initial composition of the system is shown in \autoref{fig:Libre_V6_S1}. Between 2003 and 2011 the system 
grew substancially: if on March 2003 it had 13'500 files, on March 2011 it had 57'520 files with an increment of over 40K files. \autoref{fig:Libre_V6_S2} shows the state of the repository on March 2011. Few entities are painted with a color meaning that only few parts of the codebase were touched. \autoref{fig:Libre_V6_S3} shows the state on March 2012. Closely to that date, the repository was involved in a big refactoring where the majority of the recenly added files were moved. Moreover, in this picure we initially start to see empty rings like the ones that we saw on the analysis of ArgoUML. Another important aspect of this picure is that the core was entirely modified. As we can see it is colored with yellow and entities are taller than the year before. The work on the repository was constant until June 2022. In all the AnimationFrames the center was always painted with yellow colors. This could mean that the core sill needs maintainance after 20 years of that the recenly developed features heavely relies on the core implementation, and thus it needs to be adapted. In the last 12 years, as it can be seen from \ref{fig:Libre_V6_S4}, \ref{fig:Libre_V6_S5} and \ref{fig:Libre_V6_S6} the system doubled its size. In June 2022 it counts 135'793 files. Moreover, empty rings around the core became thicker, suggesting a deletion of a whole part of the system that it might be reimplemented later.

\bigbreak
\textbf{Conclusion} As we saw from this analysis the evolution of Libreoffice was constant through its 20 years of history. 
Thanks to the aging concept of SYN, we understood that they heavely rely on code that was added 20 years ago. In fact, the core of the system was always updated, and looking that the overall size of entities, the highest are in the middle. The empy bands around the core represent a pattern that we have already recognized in ArgoUML. It means that a set of files added one after another, were removed. Pheraps these files might be an entire folder that contained a feature that was later readded. One issue that this visualization raised is the size of the system begin visulized with this approach. It is hard to infer the color of some entities, since they are too small to be individually identified.

\section{Linux}
Everyone in the field of software engineering knows Linux. It does not need any presetation. Its code is published on GitHub, available at \url{https://github.com/torvalds/linux}. Even through its development started in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, the first commit published on its git repository is dated 17 April 2005. The reason is explained on the message of the first commit\footnote{\url{https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2}}:
\begin{displayquote}
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
\end{displayquote}
He never created a repository containing the full history of Linux. The analysis ran on this repository detected almost 1M commits, with 109'829 FileHistories and more than 2M FileVersions.

Here we present only the relevant aspetcs of the Linux evolution that we have found. However, in \autoref{app:Linux_Evolution} the full evolution is depicted. \autoref{fig:Linux_V7} shows the hot spots during the evolution of the system. \autoref{fig:Linux_V7_S1} shows the state of the system on April 2006, after the first year on git. At that time the repository had 19'709 files. For the next four years the repository activity was really active. In April 2009, as we can see from  \autoref{fig:Linux_V7_S2}, almost all the files were touched. Moreover, we can start to see a band around the core. 
After 12 years since the first commit the system had 3 times its initial size. \autoref{fig:Linux_V7_S3} shows its state at that time. From this figure we can start to notice that the center of the spiral have less files rather than the edge. This can be interpreted as a good thing because it might means that old files are rewritten into newer ones. An intense development activity on Linux continued uninterruptly until April 2022. As we can see from \autoref{fig:Linux_V7_S4}, \autoref{fig:Linux_V7_S5} and \autoref{fig:Linux_V7_S6} during its recent grouwing process, the center slowly became rarefied. This is a sign that older files are now rewritten into newer ones.

\textbf{Conclusion}
 We saw how the codebase of Linux evolved since their move on git. The development activity was constant through this 17 years. The codebase started with 19'705 files and reached 77'183 on April 2022, almost four times its original size. During this time interval not only they evolved the kernel developing new features, they also started a sort of modern process to slowly get rid off the files that were added 17 years ago. In fact as we can see the center of the spiral started to became rarefied. Nonetheless, it still hold many files and this means that the current version of Linux relies on files that were written more than 17 years ago.
